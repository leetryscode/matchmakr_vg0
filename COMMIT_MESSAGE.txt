Replace Mystery Single with Invite Single Flow

GOALS:
- Remove MYSTERY_SINGLE behavior that caused 400 errors (about_single_id must be real)
- Replace "Someone Else!" selection with Invite Single modal flow
- Guide sponsors with 0 singles to invite instead of allowing chat creation
- Ensure handleSingleSelected only receives real sponsored single IDs
- Simplify UI: always show "Invite a single" button

PROBLEMS FIXED:
1. MYSTERY_SINGLE caused 400 insert errors (about_single_id must be a real sponsored single)
2. Abuse risk: sponsors with 0 singles could start chats without inviting anyone
3. Confusing UX: "Mystery Single" placeholder didn't match actual behavior

CHANGES MADE:

1. Created InviteSingleModal Component
   - New component: src/components/dashboard/InviteSingleModal.tsx
   - Headline: "Invite a Single"
   - Body copy explains rule: "Chats on Orbit are always on behalf of someone you know"
   - Email input with validation (placeholder: name@email.com)
   - Primary button: "Send invite", Secondary: "Cancel"
   - Success state: "Invite sent." then closes modal
   - Matches styling/design of other modals in project

2. Created Stub Invite Function
   - New file: src/lib/invite.ts
   - Function: inviteSingleByEmail(email: string)
   - MVP: console.logs email and returns success
   - Basic email format validation
   - Can be replaced with actual sponsor-single edge function call later

3. Updated SelectSingleModal
   - Removed MYSTERY_SINGLE constant
   - Added onInviteSingle callback prop
   - "Someone Else!" button now calls onInviteSingle() instead of handleSingleSelected(MYSTERY_SINGLE.id)
   - Always shows "Someone Else!" option (0, 1, or multiple singles)
   - Shows disabled "You have no singles yet" row when sponsoredSingles.length === 0
   - Removed all references to MYSTERY_SINGLE.id and MYSTERY_SINGLE.name

4. Updated Pond Page
   - Removed MYSTERY_SINGLE constant
   - Updated loadUserData() to set currentSponsoredSingle to null (instead of MYSTERY_SINGLE) when no singles
   - Updated top selector UI:
     * Always shows "Invite a single" button (regardless of singles count)
     * When no single selected: "Shopping for: [Invite a single button]"
     * When single selected: shows single info + selector buttons (if multiple) + "Invite a single" button on right
   - Updated handleSingleSelected:
     * Removed check for MYSTERY_SINGLE.id
     * Added validation: only proceeds if singleId is a valid sponsored single
     * Only updates currentSponsoredSingle with real singles
   - Updated openChatWithSingle:
     * Removed check for MYSTERY_SINGLE.id
     * Added guard: returns early if aboutSingleId is not a valid sponsored single
     * Ensures about_single_id is always a real single ID
   - Updated handleOpenChat:
     * Always shows SelectSingleModal (even with 0 singles)
     * Modal guides to invite flow via "Someone Else!" option
   - Added showInviteSingleModal state and handleInviteSingle function
   - Integrated InviteSingleModal component
   - Removed showMysterySingle prop from SelectSingleModal

5. Chat Creation Guards
   - handleSingleSelected validates singleId before proceeding
   - openChatWithSingle validates aboutSingleId before creating conversation
   - Prevents 400 errors from invalid single IDs
   - Ensures conversations are only created with real sponsored singles

BENEFITS:
- No more 400 errors from placeholder single IDs
- Clear UX: sponsors with 0 singles are guided to invite
- "Someone Else!" opens invite modal, never creates chat
- handleSingleSelected only receives real single IDs
- Simplified UI: always-visible "Invite a single" button
- Better security: prevents abuse of chat creation without singles
- Clean code: removed all MYSTERY_SINGLE constants and logic
