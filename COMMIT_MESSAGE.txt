refactor: rebrand to Orbit and simplify role system to two active roles

Rebrand MatchMakr/GREENLIGHT to Orbit with simplified two-role system (SINGLE and MATCHMAKR/Sponsor).

BREAKING: Product name "GREENLIGHT" → "Orbit", "MatchMakr" → "Sponsor" in UI
- Landing page, dashboard header, and metadata updated
- All user-facing "MatchMakr" references changed to "Sponsor"

FEATURES:
- Created Orbit role type system (src/types/orbit.ts) with normalization
- Added orbitConfig.ts feature flags to hide Vendor and Forum from UI
- Vendor users automatically routed to MATCHMAKR dashboard

UI HIDDEN (via orbitConfig):
- Vendor option removed from onboarding
- Green Room/Forum button removed from navigation

ROLE SYSTEM:
- New OrbitUserRole type: 'SINGLE' | 'MATCHMAKR' only
- AuthContext tracks both database userType and normalized orbitRole
- DashboardWrapper/DashboardLayout use OrbitUserRole
- Middleware normalizes vendor → matchmakr for routing

FILES ADDED:
- src/config/orbitConfig.ts
- src/types/orbit.ts
- CONTEXT.md
- ORBIT_REFACTOR_MAP.md

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/app/page.tsx, layout.tsx
- src/components/dashboard/* (multiple files)
- src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx
- middleware.ts

NOTE: Database schema unchanged. Vendor/Forum code preserved but hidden.
