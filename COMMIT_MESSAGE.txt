Fix pond chat initiation with top selector and mystery single

GOALS:
- Fix race conditions causing chat initiation failures
- Always use correct about_single_id (never wrong fallback)
- Add clear UX showing which single sponsor is shopping for
- Support sponsors with no singles via "mystery single"
- Ensure selector appears on every navigation (not just first load)

PROBLEMS FIXED:
1. Race condition: currentUser.id was null when chat initiated before data loaded
2. Wrong about_single_id: fell back to profile.id (clicked single) instead of sponsor's single
3. Top selector disappeared when navigating back from chat/dashboard
4. No support for sponsors with zero sponsored singles

CHANGES MADE:

1. Created Mystery Single Constant
   - Added MYSTERY_SINGLE constant (id: 'MYSTERY_SINGLE', name: 'Mystery Single')
   - Defined in both pond page and SelectSingleModal
   - Allows chat initiation even without sponsored singles

2. Added Top Single Selector UI
   - Always-visible selector at top of pond page
   - Shows current selected single with photo/name
   - Multiple singles: buttons to switch + "Someone Else" option
   - One single: shows that single + "Someone Else" button
   - No singles: shows only "Mystery Single"
   - Provides clear context of which single sponsor is shopping for

3. Fixed Race Condition (currentUser.id → user.id)
   - Replaced all currentUser.id with user.id from useAuth()
   - user.id is always available immediately after auth loads
   - Added null check for user at function start
   - Eliminates "Cannot read properties of null" errors

4. Fixed about_single_id Logic
   - Removed fallback to profile.id (wrong value)
   - Always uses currentSponsoredSingle.id (correct value)
   - If singleId provided from modal, uses that; otherwise uses currentSponsoredSingle
   - No more "Noel and Noel" conversations

5. Updated Single Loading Logic
   - Split loadUserDataAndProfiles() into loadUserData() and profile loading
   - loadUserData() always called on every page load (regardless of cache)
   - Ensures sponsoredSingles and currentSponsoredSingle are always set
   - Preserves user's selection when navigating back (if still valid)

6. Updated SelectSingleModal
   - Added showMysterySingle and currentSelectedSingleId props
   - Shows "Someone Else" option when one single exists
   - Shows "Mystery Single" when no singles
   - Highlights currently selected single with checkmark
   - Always shows modal (no conditional logic for single selection)

7. Simplified handleOpenChat
   - Always shows modal (allows selection even with one single)
   - Removed complex conditional logic
   - Cleaner, more predictable flow

BENEFITS:
- Chat initiation works reliably every time (no race conditions)
- Correct about_single_id always used (never wrong fallback)
- Clear UX showing shopping context
- Supports all scenarios (0, 1, or multiple singles)
- Selector appears consistently on every navigation
- Simple, maintainable code
- Fast performance (no unnecessary waits)
