# Orbit Copy Tone System (v1)

## Purpose

Orbit exists to enable trusted introductions without pressure, performance, or judgment.

The language used throughout the product must reduce anxiety, respect discretion, and signal competence.  

Orbit is not playful, not gamified, and not urgency-driven.

This document defines how Orbit speaks everywhere.

---

## Voice: Who Is Speaking

Orbit speaks as a calm, competent intermediary who takes responsibility seriously.

Not:

- a dating app

- a social network

- a playful guide

- a brand mascot

Orbit is:

- neutral but human

- deliberate, not enthusiastic

- confident without hype

If copy feels excited, salesy, or cute, it is wrong.

## Emotional Posture by User Type

### Sponsors

Assume:

- good judgment

- responsibility

- intention

Tone:

- precise

- respectful

- slightly formal

Sponsors are making decisions, not tapping buttons.

---

### Singles

Assume:

- uncertainty

- vulnerability

- sensitivity to judgment

Tone:

- steady

- reassuring

- factual, not flattering

Orbit never implies ranking, evaluation, or performance.

## Core Language Principles

### Describe reality, do not hype it

Prefer:

- declarative sentences

- present tense

- neutral verbs

Avoid:

- encouragement language

- emotional framing

- celebratory language before consent

---

### Avoid judgmental verbs

Be careful with:

- approve / reject

- accepted / declined

- passed / failed

Prefer:

- agreed

- completed

- waiting

- unavailable

---

### Do not rush people

Never use:

- urgency

- countdowns

- pressure

- "don't miss out" language

Waiting is a valid and calm state.

## Canonical Phrases

Use these verbatim where applicable.

### Introductions & Matches

- "Make the introduction"

- "Both sponsors agreed"

- "Waiting for the other sponsor"

- "This introduction is complete"

- "This introduction hasn't been completed"

### Chat States

- "Your sponsors agreed to introduce you"

- "You're now connected"

- "This conversation is visible to sponsors"

- "Messages are shared as written"

### Navigation & Surfaces

- "Your sponsored singles"

- "Managed by [Sponsor Name]"

---

## Button & Action Language Rules

Buttons describe what will happen, not how the user should feel.

Avoid:

- "Approve Match"

- "You can chat!"

- "Pending…"

Prefer:

- "Make the introduction"

- "Start the conversation"

- "Waiting for the other sponsor"

Buttons should be literal, calm, and descriptive.

---

## Banned Patterns

Never use:

- emojis

- exclamation points

- slang

- dating-app tropes ("spark", "chemistry", "vibes")

- gamified language ("unlock", "level up", "win")

If it sounds like Tinder, Bumble, Instagram, Slack, or Duolingo, it does not belong in Orbit.

---

## Microcopy Rules

### Errors

Errors should be factual and non-blaming.

Example:

"This message couldn't be sent. Please try again."

Not:

"Oops! Something went wrong 😬"

---

### Empty States

Empty states should be neutral and informative.

Example:

"No messages yet."

Not:

"Start chatting now!"

---

## North Star Test

Before writing or approving copy, ask:

Would this feel appropriate if said out loud by a trusted mutual friend?

If not, revise.
