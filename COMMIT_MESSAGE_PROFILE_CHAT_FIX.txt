Fix profile page "Message sponsor" button to match pond flow

Previously, the profile detail page's "Message sponsor" button bypassed
the SelectSingleModal gating and navigated to the wrong route
(/dashboard/chat/single/...), causing broken chat behavior.

Changes:
- ProfileClient: Fix handleOpenChat() to show SelectSingleModal instead
  of direct navigation, matching the pond page flow
- ProfileClient: Add InviteSingleModal integration for "Someone Else!"
  flow (same as pond)
- ProfileClient: Ensure SelectSingleModal receives correct props
  (currentUserId, otherUserId, clickedSingleId, onInviteSingle) so it
  can handle chat creation via chat-context API
- SelectSingleModal: Add error handling for chat-context API failures
  (shows alert instead of silent failure)
- Add MVP assumption comments noting single-sponsor model assumption

The profile page now uses the same SelectSingleModal → chat-context API →
/dashboard/chat/{conversation_id} flow as the pond page.

No changes to pond logic, schema, or RLS. Minimal, MVP-safe fix.
